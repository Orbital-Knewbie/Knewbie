## <a name="intro">1. Introduction</a><br>
Knewbie is an educational platform that provides tailored content to suit the individual's learning ability. Through the usage of our machine learning algorithm, students will be recommended content based on their current abilities to ensure that they progress at a steady rate and are not exposed to content which they are unable to do from the get go. Hence, this will provide motivation for students where they will be able to celebrate their small successes before gradually, attempting tougher challenges. Read on to find out how to use Knewbie.
